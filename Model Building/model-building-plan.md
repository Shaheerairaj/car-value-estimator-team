1. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**

**Clean and prepare data:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
**Feature Selection:** Analyze feature importance and correlations to identify the most relevant features for price prediction. Use techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance scores from a basic model (e.g., Random Forest).
**Feature Engineering:** Create new features based on existing ones (e.g., "age" by subtracting year from 2024, interaction terms like "year_km") (interaction terms aren't necessary for tree based models or for GBM models).
Consider text analysis of the "title" (simialar to Annas example).

2. **Model Selection and Training**

**Models to Try:**
**Linear Regression:** Baseline model for comparison, easy to interpret.
**Random Forest:** Powerful model for our use case. 
**XGBoost:** Powerful tree-based model for complex data and interactions (difficult to interpret but that isn't strictly necessary).
**LightGBM:** A lighter version of XGBoost. Saves on computational power required.

3. **Model Evaluation and Selection**

**Split Data:** Feel free to experimaent with you training and test splits but I recommend having 3 sets. Training, validation and test.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the average difference between predicted and actual prices. Lower RMSE indicates better performance.
**Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Similar to RMSE but uses absolute differences. Easier to interpret but less sensitive to outliers.
**R-squared:** Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable (price) explained by the model. Higher R-squared indicates better model fit.
Choose the Best Model: Select the model with the lowest RMSE/MAE on the testing set while considering interpretability and complexity. If interpretability is crucial, a simpler model with slightly lower accuracy (e.g., Linear Regression) might be preferred.

**Model Evaluation:** Apply K-Fold Cross-Validation with k >= 10

4. **Model Tuning**

Use techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to optimize the hyperparameters of each model you're testing out. This is heavy on computation so try experimenting with fewer number of parameters.

5. **Model Interpretation (Optional)**

Analyze the importance of features in the chosen model to understand which factors most influence car price predictions.
Consider techniques like feature importance scores for tree-based models or coefficient analysis for linear regression like mentioned previously.
We can also try only using the top n important features of the model and seeing how our metrics change.

**Additional Considerations: (Optional)**

**Deployment Considerations:** We need to choose a model that can be efficiently deployed to the cloud for web application use. Must consider factors like model size and computational requirements.
