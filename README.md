# Project Overview

**Objective:** To build a simple web app which will give a user an estimate of the value of a car depending on a number of set features which represent the condition of the car.

**Purpose:** Buying a car is a large investment of money and individuals usually have a difficult time determining if the value of a car is fair. They need a way to be able to measure the value or worth of a car they are interested in buying compared to similar cars according to it's condition. This will help the buyer in budgeting and negotiation.

It can also serve to help sellers to appropriately price their vehicles according to market conditions.
